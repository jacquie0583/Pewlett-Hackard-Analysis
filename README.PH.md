Using DataFrames and tabular data, we designed the entity relationship diagrams (ERDs), imported data into a database, performed some troubleshooting on common errors, and created queries that facilitated our understanding of your company allowing us to make suggestions for these highly anticipated adjustments.  Using an online tool called Quick Database Diagrams, we created a conceptual ERD.
